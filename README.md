Spaceflight Game

* Ruby version 3.1.2

Requires:

* Gosu gem

This is a project I did based on a tutorial from the Gosu Wiki https://github.com/gosu/gosu/wiki

I modified different attributes, commented on the function of various methods and used free assets
from the internet to put my own spin on the visual/audio look of the finished project.

Thanks for checking it out!
